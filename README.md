## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently working on building a professional portfolio in order to demonstrate my skill set.

Projects that I am currently working on include implementing Proxmox, OPNSense, Wazuh, OpenCTI, Security Onion, and Snort, to test cyber security concepts.

Proxmox serves as the host for all of my virtual machines.  
OPNSense is the software I am using for my network firewall.  
Wazuh will be the EDR I use to protect endpoints.  
OpenCTI will be my cyber threat intelligence platform.
